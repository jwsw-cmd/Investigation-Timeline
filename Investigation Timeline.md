# **Sexpionage Core Facts** 

* **Robert Maxwell** (Ghislaine Maxwell’s father) was a confirmed Mossad asset according to multiple Israeli and Western intelligence sources (Ari Ben-Menashe statements, Gordon Thomas biography *Robert Maxwell, Israel’s Superspy*, and declassified reports).

* **1986**: Maxwell directly participated in the Mossad honeypot/kompromat operation against Mordechai Vanunu (Israeli nuclear technician who leaked Dimona secrets). Maxwell tipped the Israeli embassy in London, facilitated the lure of Vanunu from London to Rome via female agent “Cindy,” after which Vanunu was drugged, abducted, and flown to Israel for secret trial and 18-year imprisonment. Maxwell’s newspaper *The Sunday Mirror* initially helped suppress the story before publication.

* **1980s–1991**: Maxwell allegedly distributed a bugged version of PROMIS (U.S. Department of Justice prosecutorial/intelligence tracking software) to foreign governments, banks, and nuclear labs (including Sandia and Los Alamos). The software contained backdoors that allowed Mossad remote access to sensitive data. U.S. investigations (1990–2000) largely dismissed or downplayed these claims, but they remain a longstanding allegation in intelligence literature (Whitney Webb reporting, Ari Ben-Menashe, Gordon Thomas).

* **Ghislaine Maxwell** and **Jeffrey Epstein** are alleged to have continued a similar sexpionage/kompromat operation in the 1990s–2010s, using modeling agencies (MC2, Trump Model Management connections), private islands (Little St. James), ranches (Zorro Ranch), and Manhattan townhouses to procure and record underage girls and young women for blackmail of high-profile individuals (politicians, billionaires, royalty, scientists). This is supported by victim testimony (Virginia Giuffre, Juliette Bryant, others), flight logs, hidden cameras found in properties, and 2026 DOJ file releases showing coded language in emails (e.g., “2 x 8 years old,” “your littlest girl was a little naughty”).

* **No official U.S. government confirmation** exists that Jeffrey Epstein himself was a trained or co-opted Mossad agent. The **alleged** FBI Los Angeles field office memo (2020, referenced in 2026 releases) describing Epstein as a “co-opted Mossad asset” with ties through Alan Dershowitz and the Kushners remains unconfirmed and unverified in public documents.

Robert Maxwell ran confirmed Mossad sexpionage/kompromat operations (Vanunu 1986, PROMIS backdoors alleged). Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein are credibly accused of running a parallel long-term operation targeting elites for sexual compromise and leverage, using Epstein as an intelligence asset. The network functioned as an integrated enterprise designed to carry out abuse, targeted assassinations, lobbying and influence campaigns, coercive leverage through blackmail, and sustained illicit financial gain.
